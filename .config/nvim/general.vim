" Keep undo history across sessions, by storing in file. Only works all the time.  when you exit Vim your edit history is saved so you can open the file again 2 days later and undo the changes.
"Edit history is an important part of your context so I think once you get used to it you couldnâ€™t use any other editor without this feature.
